# CDDA_Save_File_Sync
Recently I play CDDA on multiple PCs, and encountered the problem of syncing multiple game save files.
Though there are multiple existing cloud file syncing solutions, those solutions are mostly not light-weight and the maintainance is quite annoying.

Hence I wrote the python script code to sync the save file.

Ez to use:
put server.py on server, run it.
Configure the ip in client.py, put it in the same dir as the "save folder" and run it everytime before and after the game.

Will make it better in the future.
